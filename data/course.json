  "course_description": "This seminar provides intensive study of exciting texts by four influential American authors. In studying paired works, we can enrich our sense of each author's distinctive methods, get a deeper sense of the development of their careers, and shake up our preconceptions about what makes an author or a work \"great.\" Students will get an opportunity to research an author in depth, as well as making broader comparisons across the syllabus.\n",
